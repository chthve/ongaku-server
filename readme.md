# Ongaku

We are a music sharing community and we pride ourselves on our core values of creating a safe space for everyone to share, discover and enjoy music freely. 
Users can create, save and discover posts by other users, navigate throughout the whole DISCOGS music database with an emphasis on discovering music that normally users would have never heard before.

A mobile first app developed in React with Typescript on the front-end, using a SQL database with sequelize and an express server on the back end.

# WIP
